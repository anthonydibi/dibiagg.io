I've always wanted to be able to physically explore code. Sitting in a chair, staring at a screen, typing on a keyboard and wrecking my wrists has made me think about
how development could be more fun.
`

export const WhatIsThreeSharp = `
ThreeSharp aims to deliver a better development experience by bringing it into virtual reality. In the Unity-based VR environment, you can load in any C# project, and then see it visualized in full 3D. This visualization lays out your code based on relationships like namespace membership and inheritance. This means that you can more easily get a spatial understanding of your code, and how different classes and modules relate to each other.
`

export const HowItWorks = `
ThreeSharp uses Microsoft's Roslyn API to generate syntax trees from C# code. These syntax trees are used to derive insights like inheritance relationships
so that they can be applied to the visualization. The environment is built in Unity, and motion controls are implemented using Unity's Oculus XR plugin.
