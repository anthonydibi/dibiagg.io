                Deathball is an arcade game that me and my friends are addicted
                to - it's like if Rocket League had a two-dimensional baby with
                an old-school arcade RPG. You play as a wizard and attempt to
                put a ball into the other wizard's net. The only problem is that
                it is a cabinet-only game so we have to go on-site and pay 50Â¢
                to play.

                This gave me the idea to create a "clone" of the game so that we
                could play when we aren't able or wanting to go out.{' '}
                <em>Clone</em> is in quotes because my version doesn't touch the
                insane visual and mechanical polish of the original, I can only
                hope that someone plays it and says{' '}
                <em>"hey, that was kind of fun."</em>

                I built this game using Phaser 3, which is a JavaScript game
                framework. Originally I planned to develop the game in Unity,
                but I decided that it would be really inconvenient to have to
                download and install the game in order to play it. With Phaser I
                can give someone a link and they can play on any desktop device
                instantly without any setup. I like Phaser because it gives
                well-documented implementations for conventional game features
                like tilemaps, collision, scenes, etc. and since it is
                open-source if there is something about the API that I don't
                like I can just write something myself. It's also surprisingly
                performant for a web framework - with graphics acceleration
                enabled the game runs upwards of 200 fps on my machine.

                One disadvantage of hosting the game on the web is that the only
                well-supported communication API is WebSocket, and WebSocket
                only supports TCP so the prospect of making Deathball a remote
                multiplayer experience isn't great.{' '}
                <Link href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</Link> allows
                peer-to-peer UDP connections and seems to be pretty supported
                these days, it is not supported in Internet Explorer but IE has
                been discontinued <Emoji label={'celebration'} symbol={'ðŸŽ‰'} />{' '}
                so maybe that is a sign that I should add multiplayer. We shall
                see.
