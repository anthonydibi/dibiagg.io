                Deathball is an arcade game that me and my friends are addicted to - it's like if Rocket League had a two-dimensional baby
                with an old-school arcade RPG. You play as a wizard and attempt to put a ball into the other wizard's net. The only problem is that it is a cabinet-only game
                so we have to go on-site and pay 50Â¢ to play.

                This gave me the idea to create a "clone" of the game so that we could play when we aren't able or wanting to go out. <em>Clone</em> is in quotes because my 
                version doesn't touch the insane visual and mechanical polish of the original, I can only hope that
                someone plays it and says <em>"hey, that was kind of fun."</em>
