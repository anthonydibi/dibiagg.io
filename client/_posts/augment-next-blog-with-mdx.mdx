Markdown is cool, but I thought it would be nice to add more potential for interactivity to my blog
posts without making them more complicated to write, so I explored extending my current setup with MDX.
MDX is a superset of Markdown that gives it JSX support.

This is pretty powerful because it allows you to put anything you could build in React into a Markdown file.
The Markdown gets converted to static HTML like usual on the server side, and then any React components in
Markdown files are [hydrated](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/react-hydration/) on the client side.
You can also pass in a component mapping to the MDX provider:

```jsx
MDXRemote component mapping
const components = {
  img: NextImage,
  Button: Button,
  pre: ({ children, className }) => {
    return <pre>{children}</pre>
  },
  code: ({ children, className }) => {
    return className ? (
      <CodeBlock className={className}>{children}</CodeBlock>
    ) : (
      <code className="language-text">{children}</code>
    )
  },
}
```

which basically will take any JSX tags on the left from MDX files and replace them with those on the right.
This means you can take Markdown elements and replace them with something richer.
For example, the base `<code>` element in Markdown doesn't do very sophisticated syntax highlighting, and
looks kind of boring. You may have noticed that in the above component mapping I have `<code>` tags being
replaced with a CodeBlock component:

```jsx
Component for syntax highlighting
const LineNumber = (props) => (
  <Box
    color={'accent'}
    paddingRight={'0.75rem'}
    userSelect={'none'}
    display={'table-cell'}
  >
    {props.number}
  </Box>
)

const CodeBlock = ({ children, className }) => {
  const language = className ? className.replace(/language-/, '') : 'javascript'

  return (
    <Highlight
      {...defaultProps}
      code={children}
      language={language}
      theme={theme}
    >
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <Box
          as={'pre'}
          className={className}
          style={{
            ...style,
            padding: '10px',
            marginBottom: '32px',
            overflow: 'scroll',
            marginLeft: '-70px',
            marginRight: '-70px',
            textAlign: 'left',
          }}
        >
          {tokens.map((line, i) => (
            <Box
              verticalAlign={'center'}
              display={'table-row'}
              key={i}
              {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}
            >
              <LineNumber number={i + 1} />
              {line.map((token, key) => (
                <Box as={'span'} key={key} {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
              ))}
            </Box>
          ))}
        </Box>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  )
}
```

which uses `prism-react-renderer` to render a more interesting environment for code to live in.
It looks messy, but the way prism-react-renderer works gives a lot of flexibility with how you
want your code blocks to look. I was able to add line numbers that match the accent color of my
site just by throwing in a component.

And, since all Markdown `<code>` elements are replaced with this CodeBlock component, I can keep
using the easy Markdown syntax for writing code.

If you want to do this with your Next.js blog, it's actually pretty easy. Just `npm i next-mdx-remote`,
import the `MDXRemote` component,

```jsx
MDXRemote import
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'
```

and then place `MDXRemote` wherever you want your compiled MDX to show up. For my site, I have a `PostBody`
element that represents the content of each blog post, so I put it there:

```jsx
PostBody component
const PostBody = ({ content }) => {
  return (
    <Box maxW={'2xl'} mx={'auto'}>
      <Box className={markdownStyles['markdown']}>
        <MDXRemote {...content} components={components} lazy />
      </Box>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

`content` is just the return value of `next-mdx-remote`'s serialize function, which takes in an MDX
string and performs the compilation:

```jsx
Serializing markdown
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'

const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')
const content = await serialize(fileContents, { parseFrontmatter: true })
const data = content.frontmatter
```

I am using `frontmatter`, so I passed an additional option to `serialize`, but you can just leave that out
and only pass the file contents. It's really that simple - as long as you feed `serialize`'s output into
the client side `MDXRemote` component, it just works. And then you can customize the `components` that will
show up in your Markdown however you like - heck, replace `<pre><code>` with a full-fledged development
environment if you want. You can even embed a `THREE.js` canvas with `react-three-fiber`:

```jsx
react-three-fiber example
function SpinnyCube(props) {
  const mesh = useRef()
  const [hovered, setHovered] = useState(false)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
  const [accentColor, setAccentColor] = useState('')
  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode()

  useEffect(() => {
    setAccentColor(getComputedStyle(document.body).getPropertyValue('--accent'))
  }, [colorMode])

  useFrame((state, delta) => {
    mesh.current.rotation.x += delta
    mesh.current.rotation.z += delta
  })

  return (
    <mesh
      {...props}
      ref={mesh}
      scale={active ? 1 : 1.2}
      onClick={(event) => setActive(!active)}
      onPointerOver={(event) => setHovered(true)}
      onPointerOut={(event) => setHovered(false)}
    >
      <boxGeometry args={[2, 2, 2]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={hovered ? 'darkgreen' : accentColor} />
    </mesh>
  )
}

export default function ReactThreeFiberExample(props) {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <SpinnyCube position={[-3, 0.5, 0]} />
      <SpinnyCube position={[3, -0.7, 0]} />
    </Canvas>
  )
}
```

<ReactThreeFiberExample />

Cool.
